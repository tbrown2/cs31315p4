## State-Machine versus the code

Originally, the state machine diagram included only three states, stopped, alarm, and running. However, I felt that it required to also have a state where you were adding values to the counter. Moving from such a static and simple design of the state machines to a fairly complicated program using complex design decisions is very difficult.

I found that while I could have a high level understanding of the project, coding what would need to be the reactions of the application when you invoked the onClick method making an alarm sound was complicated. The devil is in the details, and the state machine can only go so far unfortunately.

I still need a couple of changes to my application - i need to have two zeroes until 10 is reached, and I didn't accomplish that. On a separate note - It definitely needs a more creative design flair. I would like to at some point accomplish the extra credit, where you add a textbox, but I unfortunately don't have enough time. 

# Background and Pair Development

My partner, Robert Hernandez, and I dropped out of contact fairly early in the process of completing this project. Moreover,I did not give myself enough time to complete the necessary objectives stress-free.I wasn't completely alone in trying to understand the concepts as I had my fellow classmates to approach and the tutors to help me understand the various concepts and challenges project 4 presented.
